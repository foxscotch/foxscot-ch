# foxscot.ch

This is the repository for my personal homepage, currently at
[foxscot.ch](https://foxscot.ch/). It's meant to look a little carrd-ish. But,
you know, by me.

The binary font files for the fonts used are not included in this repository,
but you can get them yourself with little effort from
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). They should be placed in fonts/, and
you'll obviously have to update fonts.css if you're not using the same two. Same
goes for [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Brands, which I used for the
brand icons.

Likewise, the images you see on the real website are also not present. If you
want to reuse this code you'll have to replace them with your own. But while I'm
on the subject, the excellent piece they're cropped from was by
[graskip](https://twitter.com/graskip)
([alternate link just in case](https://graskip.tumblr.com/)).

Last but not least, the CSS reset I used is of course
[Eric A. Meyer's](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).
